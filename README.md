# 1hant
1hant (one hand) is an artsey.io + graphite inspired one handed keyboard layout

the name 1hant comes from obviously one + hand with the mispelling on purpose since you need a chord for the letter d and not for the letter t :P

it is meant as an easy to use layout trying to minimalize effort pressing on the keys hence most keys are a chord with 2 keys
