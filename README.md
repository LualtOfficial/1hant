# 1hant
1hant (one hand) is an artsey.io + graphite inspired one handed keyboard layout

the name 1hant comes from obviously one + hand with the mispelling on purpose since you need a chord for the letter d and not for the letter t :P

it is meant as an easy to use layout trying to minimalize effort pressing on the keys hence most keys are a chord with 2 keys
its focused for the left hand because most people use a mouse with their right hand

### Todo:
- [ ] keybinding menu
- [ ] chord speed setting
- [ ] right hand support
- [ ] make it pretty âœ¨

### Layout:
```
-- left handed --
